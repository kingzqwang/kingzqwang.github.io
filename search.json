      "content"  : "Blogging with personal domain, Github hosted, Jekyll themesIf you are tired of common blogging with Wordpress, Pager like, and want to try some cool things of DIY, Just take a look at these combination:Buy a personal domain on Godaddy, hosted on Github, and setting you blog template with the help ofJekyll. It&amp;#39;s not a fresh thing when I write this article. So what I am aimed is to introduce a common way to add commentsto your jekyll theme. Disqus Here.Comments with DisqusIt&amp;#39;s actually a lot simpler than you might think. The main process just contains following steps: 1. Register an account on Disqus. After register of disqus account, you could go next step to register your website, such as your personal domain blog website. The whole register process is very self explanation, so I will take no more explanation here. 2. Generate code for your jekyll powered blog. The last and crucial step is to select the type of install instruction. You will see a lot of common blogger platforms. What we choose here is Universal Code here. And once you selected, Disqus will automatically generate a bit of code that look like this:&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;disqus_thread&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;        /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */    // required: replace example with your forum shortname        var disqus_shortname = &amp;#39;&amp;lt;accountname&amp;gt;&amp;#39;;        /* * * DON&amp;#39;T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */        (function() {            var dsq = document.createElement(&amp;#39;script&amp;#39;);        dsq.type = &amp;#39;text/javascript&amp;#39;;        dsq.async = true;           dsq.sre = &amp;#39;http://&amp;#39; + disqus_shortname + &amp;#39;.disqus.com/embed.js&amp;#39;;           (document.getElementsByTagName(&amp;#39;head&amp;#39;)[0]                || document.getElementsByTagName(&amp;#39;body&amp;#39;)[0]).appendChild(dsq);       })();   &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt;Please enable JavaScript to view the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;       comments powered by Disqus.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/noscript&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://disqus.com&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;dsq-brlink&amp;quot;&amp;gt;blog comments powered by       &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;logo-disqus&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Disqus&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;Now what you need to do is just putting them into the proper layout html template, post layout for example. 4.

      "content"  : "At First Sight of Builder PatternThe first time I encountered the Builder Pattern would date back to the beautiful internship time in Red Hat. What inspired me a lot is its strange setter way. 1 class PeopleBuilder { 2     private String name = &amp;quot;Joseph&amp;quot; 3     private int age = 24; 4     private String talent = &amp;quot;programming&amp;quot;; 5  6     public PeopleBuilder setName(String name) { 7  this.name = name; 8  return this; 9     }10     public PeopleBuilder setAge(int age) {11         this.age = age;12  return this;13     }14     public PeopleBuilder setTalent(String talent) {15  this.talent = talent;16  return this;17     }18 }The function will return object itself, in setter methods. Also these setter methods can avoid too many parameters in a function invocation process, such as: 1 PeopleBuilder peopleBuilder = new PeopleBuilder(); 2     /* 3      * Common definition for the doWork() function: 4      */ 5     public void doWork(String workName, int age, String talent) { 6  if(age &amp;lt; 18) { 7      log.error(&amp;quot;Can not employee cirtical labour!&amp;quot;); 8      throw new IllegalAgeException(&amp;quot;age litter than 18&amp;quot;); 9         }10  doTalent(talent);11         log.info(String.format(&amp;quot;Name:[%s], Talent:[%s]&amp;quot;, workName, talent));12     }13     /*14      * define function with PeopleBuilder object as the only parameters.15      */16     public void doWork(peopleBuilder.setAge(19).setName(&amp;quot;Heng&amp;quot;)17  .setTalent(&amp;quot;programming&amp;quot;)) {18  if(peopleBuilder.getAge() &amp;lt; 18) {19      log.error(&amp;quot;Can not employee cirtical labour!&amp;quot;);20      throw new IllegalAgeException(&amp;quot;age litter than 18&amp;quot;);21         }22  doTalent(peopleBuilder.getTalent());23  log.info(String.format(&amp;quot;Name:[$s], Talent:[%s]&amp;quot;, peopleBuilder.getName()24      , peopleBuilder.getTalent());25     }At the first glance of the above Builder Pattern usage, it resoved the too many parameters problem. However, when doWork() function invoke the PeopleBuilder class, it looks really strange and weild. Now the PeopleBuilder looks more like a POJO but a Builder. The get methods in Builder really strange. So the most important thing to do is to just figure out what the adventages and disadvantages do the builder pattern suit:1. if you find that there are too many parameters in a function invocation, you could take a consideration: could it be encapsulated into a Java Bean Object. and with necessary *get, ***set* methods.2. *Still, you find that the encapsulated class could not satify with your requirement. some construct parameters are necessary for you and some a optional. But all they could only be assigned value at first construct stage of the object. The object become read only, and be immutable.3. Then, Builder Pattern is becoming your first choice.An Example of Classical Builder Pattern.mail sender builder 1 Class EmailSender { 2  /* 3      * required parameters for send a email. 4      */ 5  private final String subject; 6  private final String from; 7  private final String to; 8  /* 9      * optional parameters.10      */11  private final String cc;12  private final String body;13 14  /*15      * private construct function with EmailSenderBuilder.16      */17  private EmailSender(EmailSenderBuilder emailBuilder) {18      this.subject = emailBuilder.subject;19      this.from = emailBuilder.from;20      this.to = emailBuilder.to;21      this.cc = emailBuilder.cc;22      this.body = emailBuilder.body;23  }24  /**25      * noted the static class accessor.26      */27       public static EmailSenderBuilder {28           private final String subject;29           private final String from;30           private final String to;31           private String cc;   /* non-final statement compared to EmailSender */32           private String body; /* non-final statement compred to EmailSender */33           public EmailSenderBuilder(String subject, String from, String to) {34               this.subject = subject;35               this.from = from;36               this.to = to;37       }38           /**39           * fluent interface idiom .40           */41           public subject(String subject) {42               this.subject = subject;43               return this;44           }45           public from(String from) {46               this.from = from;47               return this;48           }49           public to(String to) {50               this.to = to;51               return this;52           }53           /**54           * It&amp;#39;s definitely cool!

It creates a layer to abstract and unify the related interfaces in the application and define an entry point to each subsystem level and thus make them communicate only through their faces.To simplify the interaction process, we introduce the facade layer. Facade expose a simplified interface(in this case a single interface to perform that multi-step process) and internally it interacts with those components and gets job done for you one way.

A view is attached to its model or model part and get the data necessary for the presentation from the model by asking quetions. It may also update the model by sending appropriate messages. A controller is the link between a user and system. It provides the user with input by arranging for relavant views to present themselves in appropriate places on the screen. The controller receives such user output, translate it into the appropriate messages and pass these messages on to one or more of the views.Model: Data only. Get methods, set methods, etc. It is isolated. It knows nothing about View, or the controlls.View: UI only. Only show what you tell it to, and never  performs any transformation or validation logic.

Upon coming out from the campus, it naturally become a necessary part of the carel talent of a SDE.Common and basic test procedure framework will be Junit, which lay the fundation of test. Such as @Before,@Test,@After workflow, Assertions, Test Runners, Ignoring, Rule. However, when encounter complex and sophisticated system, the dependency of functions may become perplexing. It&amp;#39;s impossible to construct all this objects as the input of a to-be tested function. Mock conception arise naturally. Well in plain word, could we just mock these dependency objects, give their input parameters and expected behavior or return value. And it just exactly benefit what our test case needed. There are lots of good mock framework, such as JMock, EasyMock. All roads to Roma. I spent about three days to learn the JMock for a particular unit test code. When I come from JMock to EasyMock, I found that most prior knowledge and experience can be come in handy. I take notes here as a reminder. 1. From scratch, I just know a little about junit. If I want to write tests for a class, the meta element for test is functions. So I need to construct the context for a function test, such as the corresponding main class, the input parameters for a test, external dependency objects need to construct. also the purpose of test, do we need to Assertions? and so on. 2. with these in mind, we need to test the functionality of the methods. Is it a AssertEqual(),AssertTrue(),Expected Exception? How could we guarantee the coverage? 3. How to mock the external dependency object. This is definitely a long story. Simplify by three steps, expect what the behavior and result, replay the workflow, verify the result.Reference1. JMock Website2. EasyMock Official3. EasyMock Control Tutorial4. JMock Tutorial"

Java String 类的基础知识Q1: String 类到底创建几个对象String str = &amp;quot;Hello, World&amp;quot;;String str2 = &amp;quot;Hello, World&amp;quot;;String str3 = new String(&amp;quot;Hello,World&amp;quot;);String str4 = new String(&amp;quot;Hello, World&amp;quot;);A1: String 构造时如果是常量赋值的话首先会去常量Pool中查找是否已经存在常量如存在则直接把常量字符串的引用赋值便可如果不存在则需要在常量池中创建新的常量引用在赋值给变量的引用;而如果是new操作的化则是在堆中创建且每次都会新创建一个常量池中的对象然后在把这个对象用过new构造函数赋值给其在堆中的新对象所以答案为1122Q2:  String 中的== 和 equals操作符含义 str == str2 ? str equals str2 ? str3 == str4 ? str3 equals str4 ?A2: 通常对于字符串内容的比较我们通过equals()函数来进行而==运算符则是比较两个字符串引用是否指向同一个对象两者的区别用下面stackoverflow上的回答 因此答案为truetruefalsetrue2. Synchronized 类线程安全和效率的比较Q1: ArrayList, Vector and LinkedList 三者之间的区别A1: 可以从两方面来比较首先对于ArrayList和Vector其底层都是通过Array的连续存储空间实现可以按位快速存取但是当出入值时需要顺序后移因此效率较低而LinkedList则是用过链表的方式因此其插入效率很高但查找效率降低 然后如果单从线程安全的角度来看Vector是实现synchronized因此是线程安全但是却会因此降低了其效率引用JavaRanch上的一个回答Q2: HashMap 和 HashTable的区别A2: 可以从两方面来回答首先是线程安全的角度;其次是是否允许空值的角度而HashTable都可以看作是对HashMap的限制和提高因此HashMap是非线程安全的且是允许一个null键和多个null值的而HashTable是线程安全的且是不允许null值和键的最后可以从扩展性上来看如果想要默认插入顺序的可以选择LinkedHashMap如果想要线程安全的可以使用ConcurrentHashMap更详细的解答仍旧是看stackoverflow上的解答3. Overloading vs override in JavaQ1: Overloading 和 Override之间有什么区别A1: Overloading称之为重载通常是同一个功能的函数为了实现不同的输入参数个数和类型等需要在一个对象中定义的多个函数而Override则通常是存在与父类和子类中的同一个函数其参数类型和个数都相等在子类中对其重新实现且覆盖了原先的方法而Overriding通常有两种一种是vitual函数的overriding另一种是非virtual函数的overriding前者是一种动态的绑定而后者是一种静态的 具体区别如下"

After installing, you need to do a simple configure of git for your name and emails:git config --global user.name &amp;quot;Your Name&amp;quot;git config --global user.email &amp;quot;Name@example.com&amp;quot;also you can configure for you favorite editor or diff tools(optional):git config --global core.editor &amp;quot;vim&amp;quot;and you can configure your git to display with color:git config --global color.ui true3. then, you need configure ssh key for pull and push on the bitbucket repository. here, I already configure itforyou, and I will send to you by email, with usage attached. so just skip if you would care the configure details.otherwise, a tutorial here.4. now, it time to pull the repository down, just copy the following command, and execute it:git clone git@bitbucket.org:lengerfulluse/acl-multiling.gitafter the pull completement, you will find the directory acl-multiling in your current working directory. That&amp;#39;sthe repository on the cloud.Notice: you run the git clone command just for the first time you pull a repository. After that, every time youwork on the existed repository, the first step is to run the git pull to ensure that your repository is the already up-to-date.5. you can work on your local repository now, for example do some modify or add a file to the directory, afterthat you can check  what files you have modify or create:git status6. then you add the file and commit it:git add &amp;lt;file you modified&amp;gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;message you want to say about this commit&amp;quot;7. you can continue to work on the local repository and do the loop as step 5 and step 6. you can also nowpushyour current commit to bitbucket repository.  Also before the push step, you&amp;#39;d better do the pull operation againto ensure the newest status of your local repository. so you should do:git pullif there doen&amp;#39;t exist some emerge conflict, then:git pushThat&amp;#39;s all, it simply contains normal workflow loop. It is strongly recommended to read the great arts ProGit.Also we can do a simple demonstration together.

Unfortunately, I haven&amp;#39;t konw the tricy to gain all this information, maybe the most efficient way is toview the post information from the browsers in a login request.  commonly, the username and passwd is neccessary, and the password often needsto do the md5sum process. also the entire connection strings is litte OPAC.the text process from the return http response informations.

The problem is this: I would do some ideal summary for a set of newswires about a particular topic. for example every topic contains about ten documents, which each is about an specified aspect, also connected with the times sequences. However, the time orders about the topic is only embeded in the content of the documents. When you concatenate all this sub-topic documents into a large topic sets to so the following ideal summary task about the particular topic, you would be confused by the un-order docment sets.And that&amp;#39;s just what the point we aim to solve.Particular and Important ScriptAlthough shell script are almost the same in essentials while differing in minor points. To ensure the accuracy of this article, I just decide to limit my note about the shell script on the bash shell. Therefore, the position of this post is aim to get some conclusion about the experience during the usage of the bash script.It&amp;#39;s definitely an amazing thing that when you feel that you are just write beautiful code skilfully. Especially that when you encounter a pariticular problem ,and you find that it can be resolved by the computer elegant and high-efficiency. That&amp;#39;s the origin of the sense of achievement.  Now, let&amp;#39;s cut the cackle to just begin our particular requirement and resolution.First we need to divide our problems into some basic modules. they mainly contains three modules: method to extract the date in the documents; formatted the date from the extracted data string; sort and concatenate the date, generate the results.Normalized the Text and Extract the date StringDuring the process of hummanic translation from english to chinese, we conduct our work by three groups of people. and due to the discrepency of encoding system of ther editor, the result files contained incongruous encoding such as UTF-8 encoding, UTF-8 BOM encoding, ascii encoding and so on, so the first things I need to do it normalize the while encodings of the translations files. Therefore, I just write a simple script to check the encoding of files, and find the unmatched encoding, and then to converted them automatically or manually.Then, There comes the steps of extract the date string from the translated texts. the first things to do is to delete the blank lines in the texts. this tricky is also very important. it makes me re-relizes the function of sed to execute some other command, such as deletion, except for the common used substitued operations. And following the compress blank lines process, I adopt the grep -o option to extract the date information from the strings. also I learning about the array construction method through the bash substitution operations. It make me notices that some useful bash test conditions such as -z: stands for empty. -n: stands for empty string. also the iteration methods of array for file in ${array[@]}, also some logic operations. ! and -o, -a. One of most important may the usage of functions. how to defintion a function in bash, and pass paramters to the function and return values from it. Morely, such as the local and global variables.All in a word, I feel that this attemption just make me write code more easily. Also the standardlize of write code is the most important things I should develops.  Just write the code like compose a poem.  That&amp;#39;s the philosophy of Perl languages.Sort accroding to the dateThe last things to do is just sort the extracted date which belongs to corresponding docs in a particular topics. Here, I also find that the most ultimately and effective methods to learning the usage of sort. And all these things cannot not be finish once. And since you have encounter before, you should find that only by the combination of sytemic learning of the tutorial with the practical problems resolution you can truely master the essentials. And that&amp;#39;s the different of proficient and possibility.ReferenceAdvanced Bash-Scripting Guide"

Ok, let&amp;#39;s get start.Locale Type and Environment VariablesThe introduction part generally describe some aspects about what particular a lcoale seems contains. and As we know, all these have theirstandard definition, context and content details. For the locale, the ISO files have the regular and comprehensive definition. It may containthe following aspects and in unix-like system, It&amp;#39;s demonstrated as Locale Environment Variables.- LANG the default definition for all local settings at once. while allowing the further individual customization via LC_* settingsbelows.- LC_CTYPE define the character handling properties for the system. The determines which characters are seen as part of alphabet, numbericand so on, This also determine teh character set used, if applicable.- LC_COLLATE define the alphabetical ordering of strings. This effects eg. output of sorted directory listing.- LC_MESSAGE Programs&amp;#39; localization for applications use message based localization.- LC_MONETARY define curry units and formatting of currency type, numberic values.- LC_NUMBERIC define formatting of numberic values which are not monetary.- LC_TIME define formatting of data and time.- LC_... main contains other setting.- LC_ALL A special value to overriding all the above settings.The linux system self provide a lot of locale for almost all of the countries and regions. the specific locale directory is/usr/share/locale/, which provide the locale resource files. By default, all kinds of locale contained Here.Setting localeThe first step of settings is to know what locale our system current use. Here we need the locale command. which is used for getlocale-specific informations.If we want to know what current locale our system support now, we should add the -a options for the localecommand. If you find that there doesn&amp;#39;t exist the locale you wanted , you should generate the locale by yourself. which contain two steps:1. edit the /etc/locale.gen configure file to add the locale you want.2. run the command locale-gen to generate the locale.Now, since we have generate the locale we need, we need to setting the locale. Like common linux configure sytles, almost every configuresettings have the different apply range. namely the system-wide and personal user settings. and no exception for the locale. there are twochoice to setting the locale. if you want to settingt the system-wide, you can edit two setting files.    /etc/env.d/02locale --&amp;gt; LANG=&amp;quot;enUS.UTF-8&amp;quot; for instance.    /etc/profile --&amp;gt; export LANG=&amp;quot;enUS.UTF-8&amp;quot; for instance.and for user specified range.    $HOME/.bashprofile --&amp;gt; LANG=&amp;quot;enUS.UTF-8&amp;quot; for instance.Of course the above just simple give a simple example, you can give a specified setting for LC_* Variables for yourself."

So I log out the Gnome and back to the GDMlogin manager to see whether there are some other Sessions for selection. Bla bla bla, Fluxbox has just been waiting for me. Great, It&amp;#39;s You.Configure FluxboxThe main confiugre file is under the user&amp;#39;s Home directory, which is adopted a common configure style .fluxbox/. and it contains all aspect ofthe fluxbox, from the start application with fluxbox, to the menu item selection, windowmenu, keyboard shortcuts and background of thedesktop.

      "content"  : "In this article, we focus on some basic and foundational introduction about the X11 related topics in our linux experience.Xorg ServerThere are mainly two sub-sections in the Xorg Server section. firstly, I will conduct some introduction and explanation about the history and roles Xorg take in our hole GUI system. secondly, I&amp;#39;ll give a practical example to show the process of problem trackback and solved.Login Manager or Display ManagerTo some kinds, when you setup the xorg server and install the Window manager or Desktop Environment you could start the X11 system with just a command start x. But if you want the show the GUI graphic system all the way, and you won&amp;#39;t want to start the x system in console, you need the help of Login manger, the default login manager for the Gnome is gdm. and correspondly, for Fluxbox, the slim is an ideal choice. Just with these simple line, you could use it.equo install x11-misc/slimvim /etc/conf.d/xdmand the make the change of the following:, which is the core of choice.---DISPLAYMANAGER=&amp;quot;slim&amp;quot;---finally, you should add the xdm to default run-levels.rc-update add xdm defaultAfter finish the basic configure for the slim, and set the/etc/conf.d/xdm variable, we should be able to login our personal Xsession with the default themes in the /usr/share/slim/theme.However, we should notice that the /etc/slim.conf configure script file will automatically read the /etc/X11/Sessions/ directory tofind the default multiply Session, so when you login in with the slim, you could select your particular session with a simple F1 key.Otherwise, if you want to set the default session environment, the simplest way is just:ln -s /etc/X11/Sessions/fluxbox ~/.xsessionAnd let&amp;#39;s conclude the above process. Simplely, if we want to create a X window system with Xorg server, what exactly methods we need to docontains only three steps:Install the Xorg server related source and config for them.Setting the kernel support for the input and video driversupport. here we should notice that there exists some problems compatiableproblem related to the lagecy video drivers with the KMS(Kernel ModSet tenique), so we should first disable all of the driver for the video.and then select the proper &amp;quot;nouveau&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;nvidia&amp;quot; drivers. and the &amp;quot;endev&amp;quot; input driver.Istall the related driver as listed above and set thecorresponding support for the KMS technique.equo install ${qlist -CI x11-drivers} * Install the Xorg server, and further configure manually.equo install xorg-server * configure the /etc/X11/Xorg.conf.d/ directory files. for thekeyboard and Screen resulations. * Verify the successful installation of the xorg with commandstartx, for abvious and essy test setting, you can first installsimple xterm and twm to test the xorg&amp;#39;s installation and configuration.Install a window manager or desktop environment. After you canvalidate the success of xorg server, the next thing you should complete is toarrange a slave for the xorg-server boss. And the xorg just assigns lots of dirty and hardship work to it&amp;#39;s slave, namely window manager, ormore functional Desktop environment. Formally, window manager is a kind of programs which are reponsible for the arrangement, sechdule andposition of the GUI programms. Here I will just install the most famous lightweight, Fluxbox.equo install fluxboxand after its installation, you can just configure it&amp;#39;s behaves accroding to the conf.d in &amp;#92;$HOME directory ~/.fluxbox. such as you cansetting the global keyboard shortcuts, the menu content, the wallpaper, the slit and of course the applet widget in the taskbar slit. Choose your favirate Login manager. Yes, don&amp;#39;t take it for grant,allthough there will be no any problems if you type the command startxand following by the command startfluxbox. or more simplely to edit the .xinitrc file in your home directory to add the &amp;#39;startfluxbox&amp;#39;command in this. however, leave no consideration for the issues of security from the terminal, if you just do your daily work in X windowenvrioment, it becomes naturally that there is no necessary for the intermediate steps for execute all this command in console. That&amp;#39;s wherethe Login Manager benifits for.  the configure step has just been demonstrated above, we&amp;#39;ll leave no more words here.Xorg TroubleshotingsOne of the most important reasons that Xorg server confuse people is that its huge and compliated contents and terminology conceptions, whichall are almost divert us away. also the whole installation process is automatically done, so once there encounters some problems, It&amp;#39;s justterrible, and in most situation, people would select install the whole system. ^_^. I am at least. I always wonder that when I could resolvethis problem myself, here today, I came over a startx failure, and after some dianostic, I finish it eventually.  Here I note some basic andimportant steps:- You&amp;#39;re aim to solve the problems: the first and the only step is to analyze current problem. What&amp;#39;s the symptoms of the problems, isthere some log or error output? how many possible reasons for this/these symptoms? what&amp;#39;s the most possible one?- Be careful and most selective for the search keywords when Google, also you should first finish some basic background knowledge learnint tohave a better understanding of the problem.- Do necessary backup work. when you attempt to some possible solutions for the problems, you&amp;#39;re experiment on the system, back up theoriginal version files or programs, before you do every dangerous things!!"

Althought the journal is full of uncetain hardships, The excitingof achievement is beyond all these things. When you came over all the way, I can have fruitness harvest which are not only the knowledge orsome cool skills you got, But another most important things in your life,  the courage to conquer every things, the belief to complete tasksefficiently and perfectly. If we compare life to be a war, It is the wapean that determines the success or failure. Similarly, proper toolsfor our daily work is extremly improtant, I used to be curious about every linux distribution, for instance, Ubuntu, OpenSuse,FreeBSD, Backtrack, ArchLinux, all for the desktop environment too, Gnome, KDE, Xfce, Awesome etc. not to say alot of application tools, shell and so much others. However, it&amp;#39;s just to be dispointed that I just cannot stop my step to get further on someparticular useful tools.

I come contacted with linux since when I was a freshman inNUPT. What attracted me a lot lies in that the compize&amp;#39;s cool cubic destkop effects.

My mental ask to find the previous project&amp;#39;s source programming, which maybe re-used in our current&amp;#39;s project. Accidently, I have no idea where this source I put it. After doze of endeavours, I gave up, and of course felt very dispointed the whole day. I retrospect my this horrible habit, that leave the staged things away. I get the conclusion that I would never re-use or do some back-review work on this done things in mostly situations. And to some exents, except the remain knowledge in my brain, I could hardly adopt any excellent methods or design which is perfectly completed before. In other words, I often tend to reinvent the wheel.Horrible HabitsRemember that when I was just a little boy, my grandfather often told me that How important to form the habit of arrangement. Arrangement of our daily events and our mind. However this simple but also profound words almost don&amp;#39;t have any influence on me. from the kidgardon time to the high school age, all the whole of my life and study is just benifited from brain and not to bad memory. Unfortunately, with the increase of our ages and the extend of our life, the knowledge grow rapidly. The big bang of our knowledge make me unpromising and hopeless to my self. It&amp;#39;s a long time before I could came over my un-believable of capability. Until that, I still didn&amp;#39;t recongize it is exactly the inadequate methods that prevent me from my ideal success. In one words, I didn&amp;#39;t know how to study and work efficiently. I was eager to seek new and curious knowledge and tools, but never come back to think the practical meanings and effect behind it.Knowledge and Capability Come from ArragementNo one believe that if you own a book, you know all the knowledge and lessons in that book. your knowledge is not decided by how many books you reads, but how much you learn from them. Our brain like all logic and sequece things, it hates unsuitable tedious and dirty. If you put a lot of unrelated or unsorted things in your mind,  it will easily got confused and even refuse to work for you. the spirit or nature of arrangement and category is exactly to make logical sort for our brains. Our brain tends to connect the new isolated knowledge node to the exist large net of knowledge. Knowledge is power, of course, knowledge rise capability. An important approach to improve our capability lies in form the habit of make arrangement for our brain.Some Useful Approach or Tricky TipsFrom a perspective of a techniquer, Our whole time commonly is dedicated to three things. Our work, here I refer to the true and real work, which we like it and enjoy the moment of working. Our daily Transaction, people&amp;#39;s social property determines that It cannot be avoided to do some daily personnel or social things. The last one is our life which is also the important part besides our work.Tonight, I just discuss the first part, namely arrangement for my work. Every things in our work, we should do some principal or common resolution to simplify our daily life.- Software  Exactly, It cannot be avoided that we need do a lot of programming working in our daily project work. Therefore, it is naturally will have a ot of finished or unfinished software, which contain the source code itself, als related documents, material, data sets or other project-related  things.- Learning Material Knowledge grows every moment, You will leave the queue if you stop learning. There learning material mainly contain some tool-like material, such as language learning tutorial, some useful utilies or tools in our daily tasks, such as markdown language, LaTex for typesetting, even Vim manuals.- Research For a schalor, or a master student, We should have our own research fields and interst research directions. It distinguish us from the college students or others. For the research parts, we should put attention on the algorithms and it&amp;#39;s implementation methods or tools."

All in all, I seek for other interesting features in other language.

On one hand, Allthought each one has merits and its area of expertise, you can just show the most suitable for the specific problem. On the other hand, all roads to Roman. Classical book SICP tells me that except the essential programming paradigms difference under the two branches of functional and imperative, all their sub-branches share lots of commons. the only main difference lies in the discrepancy of syntax sugar. For instance, their all have basic and similar syntax. basic data type(though may distinguish between strong and weak type, dynamical and static), Conditional statement(though it seems little different, such as if else for C Java, if ; then elif done for shell, if : for python. ), Control flow (such as for loop, while loop, break, continue), also some basic data structure, such as array, list, hashmap ( or dictionary in Python and Perl). also some basic function( no matter it&amp;#39;s member function of OO language or function), And also the most important part is its function library(C,C++) or Package(Java) or Module(Perl or Python).However, In some kinds, you can also think that the above things is just touch the superical part of languages. Because You can&amp;#39;t become an experience and professional programmers with just that. As an chinese old sayings: a man can lead a horse to the water but he cannot make him drink. For the practical enterprise project development, there are often two focus: the develop efficiency and quality of product. there are lot of principals and conventional. it is that distinguish the normal and professional programmers. these potential things can alos thought as something like design pattern and software engineering.All right, we get involved too much.Intersting features borrowingTo design a language is to shut oneself up in a room making a cart, they all borrow a lot of  excellent features in exising languages. For instance, Perl borrows features from other languages including C, shell scrpting, AWK, sed. which obviously will provide it great power in the text processing applications tasks.Python&amp;#39;s design philosophy emphasizes the code readability.Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, general-purpose pure OO languages that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features.

Especially for GUI programming.Since GUI RoadI do remember the sence that when I first met the GUI programming. It laid a deep impression on my mind. Since then, you recognized that you can do such beautiful and professional(seems like) windows interface yourself.Just like many modern normal college students, the materials where you first encountered programming are basically textbook. As a consideration of your low-level computer skills, Unix-like OS just makes most people tedious and be kept away naturally.One of most important member in Windows eco-systems, MFC become my first station in GUI programing travel. Before that, I were very curious about the principal of how can people can implement such complicated windows system with just simple syntax of program languages. How just all that things works!  So, in summar of 2009, for the sake of Image CUP of NUPT, I begin a nice travel with about one month time. How perfect that time!Last year, I gave another attempt about GUI in java awt and Swing framework, the whole process is surface and short. Except that I was tried by all these framework and their logic relations and event sequence.Recently, It&amp;#39;s maybe partly caused by the great intrest about Python language, it&amp;#39;s nice syntax and board applications programming fields appeals me a lot.  So when encount the same situation of indexing and searching modualr implementation, I just truned around to another new pypass. I decided to try something new, wxPython GUI framework. To be honestly, It&amp;#39;s not an easy way, which makes me rethink the natural things about the GUI programming themselves, not just the personnal detailed modular or funtions.A good story just starts...App or Window or DocumentNoted here. In my superficial experience, there are two main basic components in common GUI programing. the App and Window, the former is responsible for the entrance of whole programming, the invoke of windows event loops. In other words, you can regard it as working background. And the latter is window, namely graphic user interface, which show applications&amp;#39; appearances. it interact with user, recieve user response and respond results back to the user through the GUI demonstration too. If we dig it deeper, we can find the key roler laid in the window contains the various of window Widgets (which layout frame or container) and Event Bind and handlers.Equipped with above two weapons, you could finish some basic and simple tasks, whcih rely on some not so complicated dialogs or widgets to show or interact with users, even in the age of user experience first. However, if you want the whole object storage or realtime user interaction operation, such as text/word processor, games applications, You just hit the skin. Document can be viewed as a store or serialize object, which is in charge of the data management. It also manage partly the communication between the data and methods.For Complicated Logic Relation in GUII found it just very difficult to grasp the whole skeleton of the GUI programming. Put simply, it means that when you sit at your computer, open your favorite editor(Vim for example) or other popular IDE environment, you just become confused. Where should I start from? There exists a lot of tool-tricy logic sequeces in the whole programming procedure."

      "content"  : "For a part of project, the demands for the gui interface enforce me to find a simple and flexibile toolkit-like to develop a desktop programming. the two main choices are the Swing and wxPython. The java things bores me a lot in before. So I decide to try something new, since I have a lot of interest in python recently.Modules introductionwxPython is a cross platform toolkit for creating desktop GUI applications. the principal author is Robin Dunn. wxPython consists of the five basic modules..|-- Controls: provides the common widgets, such as Button, Toolbar.|-- Core: consists of elementary classes. Object, Sizers, Events.|-- GDI: used for drawing onto the widgets.|-- Misc: various other classes and modules. logging, configuration.|-- Windows: consists of various windows. Panel, Dialog, Frame etc.Widgets are called controls in windows. GUI programming is a tedious project, the main reason lies in that the inner logical flow troubles me a lot. such as when you try to create a menuitem, you should first contruct a MenuBar object, then a Menu object, and then construct a menuitem, finnally append the menu object to the menubar object. Also you should bing the event to the itemmenu object.SizerThe programmer specifies the position and the size of each widget in pixels. when you use the absolute positions, you should understand several things:- when you resize the window, the size and the position of widgets do not change.- applications look different on various platforms.- changing fonts might spoiled the layout.- it&amp;#39;s difficult to redo the layout.Sizer address all those issues, we can choose among these sizers:    .    |-- wx.BoxSizer enable us to put several widgets into row or column.    |-- wx.GridSizer lays out widgets in two dimensional table, each cell has the same size.    |-- wx.FlexGridSizer all cells have same height in a row.    |-- wx.BagSizer the most complicated sizer.EventsEvents are integral part of every GUI application. All GUI application are event-driven.Event object is an object associated with the event. It is usually a window. Event type is a unique event, that has been generated. Event binder is an object, that binds an event type with an event handler.Widgetswx.Buttonwx.ToggleButtonwx.StaticLinewx.StaticTextwx.StaticBox it is used to logically group various widgets.wx.ComboBox a single line text field, a button with a down arrow image and a listbox.wx.CheckBox notice that, like the togglebox, it has two states.wx.StatusBarwx.RadioButtonwx.Gauge It has an indicator to show the current state of a task.wx.Sliderwx.SpinCtrlreference[1]: *wxPython tutorial *"
